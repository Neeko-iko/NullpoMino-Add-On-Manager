about this:
The NullpoMino Add-On Manager was made due to NullpoMino's terrible tracking of skins - constantly having to delete them, rename files, so on and so forth.  This program would allow for users to quickly and effectively update their game without having to fiddle with a boatload of file management issues - just a poorly written command console.

Adding new skins or sound effects:

if you decide you want to add a skin or sound pack, just dump it into the folder you set for it - whether it be the default or custom.  Once you've done that you can launch the program and it'll pick up however many folders you have.


Blockskins:

Blockskins are weird as heck and don't really work as intended.  Once we can figure them out we'll update this.
For right now don't worry about blockskins

Imports:
Imports are if you want to dump something like a rule or replay file into your nullpomino folder without having to go through the hassle of opening a bunch of folders.
It will not be checked upon launch.  This means that you can dump stuff into it after you launch the program.

Fonts:
Fonts are the .TFFs that NullpoMino uses.
They act very similar to Visuals and Sound effects - just without extranous folders.



EXTRACTS:

Extractions just pull from the designated place in the NullpoMino folder and send them to a ZIP in the same folder the script is in.

You can force the script to just straight up delete them in the config if you just want it to clean your folders out for you.


Config: 
the config file will save preferences and directories.
do not add any lines to the config.
