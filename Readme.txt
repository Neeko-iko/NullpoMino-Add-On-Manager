about this:
the NullpoMino Add-on Manager was created due to Add-ons being tedious and hard to manage - yet simple

how to use this:


adding folders to folders:
When creating a new folder for an Add-On, remember to make the title of the folder all caps and to not have any other folders inside of the ones you create.

Skins:
When adding skins make sure to keep every skin in its own folder with the names of what it replaces - back0.png, back1.png title.png, etc.

Sound Effects:
When adding sound effects make sure to keep every pack in its own folder with the names of what it replaces - erase1.wav, erase2.wav, etc.


Blockskins:
if you're using a custom folder make sure that there is a blockskins folder avaiable, along with big, normal, and small, similarly to how NullpoMino has it set up in the first place, thanks.

Dump any blockskin in there and once the program is ran it'll move it into your nullpomino blockskin folder with the correct labelling (it won't check for dupelicates)




Config:
the config saves whatever preferences you previously set.
If you decide later on that you want to change them, go ahead.
do not add any lines to the config file.
