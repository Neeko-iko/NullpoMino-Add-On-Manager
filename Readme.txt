about this:
The NullpoMino Add-On Manager was made due to NullpoMino's terrible tracking of skins - constantly having to delete them, rename files, so on and so forth.  This program would allow for users to quickly and effectively update their game without having to fiddle with a boatload of file management issues - just a poorly written command console.

Adding new skins or sound effects:

if you decide you want to add a skin or sound pack, just dump it into the folder you set for it - whether it be the default or custom.  Once you've done that you can launch the program and it'll pick up however many folders you have.


Blockskins:

Blockskins will be checked for upon launch, if some are found, they will be moved to your NullpoMino directory.


[WARNING: ONCE THEY ARE MOVED, THEY WILL BE DELETED TO PREVENT DUPLICATION]

If none are found they will be ignored.

(won't check for duplicates)


Config: 
the config file will save preferences and directories.
do not add any lines to the config.
